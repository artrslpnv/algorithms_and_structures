## there are implementations of several algorithms such as prefix function finding algorithm, Aho-corasick, Ukkonen  algotighms and etc. , there were implemented as practice in object-oriented programming (the basic language is C++). However the Fast Fourier transform is implemented in Jupyter notebook (for easier visualization by using matplotlib)
